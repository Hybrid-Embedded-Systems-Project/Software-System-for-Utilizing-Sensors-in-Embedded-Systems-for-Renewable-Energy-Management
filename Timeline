Week 1: Project Planning and Initial Setup
Days 1-2: Project Planning

Define clear project objectives and expected outcomes.
Identify and list the renewable energy sources to be managed (solar, wind, etc.).
Assign roles to team members based on expertise.
Days 3-4: Theoretical Research

Research on types of sensors used in renewable energy systems (photovoltaic sensors, anemometers, thermocouples, current, and voltage sensors).
Study the data each type of sensor provides and its relevance to energy management.
Days 5-7: Coding Environment Setup

Install Python and MATLAB (if being used).
Set up a version control system like Git.
Begin exploration of libraries for sensor data simulation (like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization).
Week 2: Sensor Integration and Data Collection
Days 8-10: Sensor Simulation

Write classes in Python to simulate the input from different sensors.
Ensure classes are modular to easily adapt to real sensor data in the future.
Days 11-12: Data Handling

Develop functions for real-time data collection from the sensor classes.
Implement initial data preprocessing and storage mechanism (e.g., using SQLite or Pandas DataFrame).
Day 13-14: Basic Data Analysis

Begin coding simple algorithms to analyze sensor data.
Create visualizations to understand data patterns and integrity checks.
Week 3: Data Analysis and Feedback System
Days 15-17: Advanced Data Analysis

Code more complex data analysis functions, potentially using machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn).
Evaluate the need for data normalization or transformation.
Days 18-19: Feedback Control System

Design theoretical feedback control mechanisms for energy management based on sensor data.
Start implementing basic control algorithms in Python.
Day 20-21: Integration and Testing

Integrate data analysis modules with the feedback control system.
Perform unit testing on individual modules.
Week 4: Optimization and Final Testing
Days 22-24: System Optimization

Optimize the code for efficiency and accuracy.
Conduct performance testing and optimize based on results.
Days 25-26: Final Integration

Integrate all components into a cohesive software system.
Ensure that the system meets the real-time data processing requirements.
Days 27-28: Documentation and Reporting

Document the software design, implementation details, and usage instructions.
Prepare the final project paper and presentation materials.
Days 29-30: Presentation Preparation

Rehearse the in-class presentation.
Refine the project paper based on feedback from practice presentations.
Throughout the month, it's crucial to maintain regular meetings to assess progress, troubleshoot issues, and adjust the timeline as needed. Also, engage in continuous learning about embedded systems for renewable energy management to incorporate the latest research and best practices into the project.
